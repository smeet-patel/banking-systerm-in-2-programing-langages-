# My Bank

I wanted to explore python and C# programming languages by creating two almost identical console base banking system application with simple features such as adding a new customer and account, deleting a record, modifying details, and bankers can look the records of all customers. As well as transferring payments from one customer to another, clearing and accepting a cheque. Also, for python, I made a real-time currency conversion using APIs.
